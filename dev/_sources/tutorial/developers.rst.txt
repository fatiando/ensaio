Using Ensaio in your project
----------------------------

One of the main use cases of Ensaio is to provide reproducible and
easy-to-access data for the documentation of other Python projects.
These are a few tips and tricks for using Ensaio in your own project.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-22

Importing a specific version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The recommended way to import Ensaio is:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-27

.. code-block:: default


    import ensaio.v1 as ensaio

    fname = ensaio.fetch_southern_africa_gravity()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-40

.. note::

    Replace ``v1`` with the version you want.

Major releases of the data collection that
break backwards compatibility (and would be likely to break your code) are
encapsulated in their own modules.
So using the :mod:`ensaio.v1` module will make sure your code works with
any version of Ensaio.

Of course, please try to update your code to use newer versions of the data
collection whenever possible.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-65

Download from GitHub on CI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the data source for Ensaio is an archive with a given DOI.
You can also specify alternative data download URLs using the
``ENSAIO_V1_URL`` environment variable (each data version gets their own
variable so adjust accordingly).

We recommend using the environment variable to download from the
GitHub release of the data when running on continuous integration (CI).
This will minimize the load that is placed on public data servers like
Zenodo.
When using GitHub Actions, this may even make the downloads much faster since
the data source is likely physically closer to the CI infrastructure.

See the ``URL`` module-level variables for each version to find the exact URL
you need (like :const:`ensaio.v1.URL`).

.. important::

    You may need to update the URL whenever you update Ensaio to access new
    data added in a minor data release.
